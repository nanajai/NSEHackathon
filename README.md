What we built : 

Product Name : Blockable 

What it is : Blockable provides users with the ability to store their digital identity on the block chain. Their identity is a combination of key value entry pairs (i.e. Aadhar number, PAN, address etc.).

Relevant bodies : There are three relevant bodies in this ecosystem - User, Third Party, Central Authority. 

User : Can request upload/edit access of documents via central authority. Also has ability to request 'Central Authority' to grant access to 'Third Party'. 

Central Authority : This can be government body or any trusted authority that has ability to perform upload/edit/grant third party access. 

Third Party : Bank/Landlord i.e. any body who needs to validate your identity.
